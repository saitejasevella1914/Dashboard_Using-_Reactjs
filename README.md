# Dashboard 

This project is a dynamic CNAPP Dashboard built with React, Zustand, TailwindCSS, and Recharts. It allows users to visualize security and cloud posture data across different categories like CSPM Executive Dashboard, CWPP Dashboard, and Registry Scan. Users can add custom widgets by providing JSON data, which automatically renders as donut charts, vertical bar charts, or progress bars depending on the category. Widgets can also be searched, refreshed, or deleted, with changes persisted in local storage for a seamless experience. The dashboard is highly modular, responsive, and user-friendly, enabling interactive visualization of critical cloud and security metrics in real time.
